# CS50
These are some projects that I have done in CS50 (Havard Univeristy's Introduction to Computer Science course)
  1. dictionary.c
      
  2. dna.py
  4. filter.c
  5. lab7.sql
  6. pset7.sql
  7. tideman.c
     I coded a program that runs a Tideman voting method. This method works by drawing a graph of candidates where an arrow from candidate A to candidate B implies that A wins against B. The winner of this election is the one who has no arrow pointing at them. In this C program, i used typedef struct to pair 2 candidates, so that means each pair should have one winner and one loser. Then I compare the votes to know who's the winner, afterthat I have a function prototype to update the ranks of the candidates which is an array.
